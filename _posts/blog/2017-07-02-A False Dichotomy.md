All to often, in articles and in spoken conversation, I hear the term "Science versus Religion." I would like to propose that this is a false dichotomy. There is no good reason these two lenses, that we as humans use to view and understand the world, have to contradict one another. I have found that when I study science with an open mind and an open heart, my faith in the God I belive in increases. Likewise, when I study theology with an open mind and heart, it puts me in a state of awe and wonder of the universe, and I find myself incredibly grateful for the math and science that helps us understand how this magnificent universe works.

A few years ago, my then 8 year old daughter, asked me a question. "Daddy," she said. "Where do dinosaurs fit into the Bible?" I have always been intrigued by the "debate" of Evolution versus Creation. It is a topic I have studied and wrestled with off and on since I was about her age. My daughter would not settle for some easy answers either. When she wants to know something, she will keep going until she gets an answer she is satisfied with. It had been a long time since I had considered the topic with any sort of serious study, so I figured I better get to work.

As part of my research, I read a fantastic book by Dr. Denis O Lamoureaux, called [I Love Jesus and I Accept Evolution]("https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0081IFV9S"). Dr. Lamoureaux holds three doctoral degress -  dentistry, theology, and biology. His own personal story is fascinating, and I would hihgly encourage anyone to read his book. In his book, he makes the claim that Evolution versus Creation is a false dichotomy. He does a fantastic job of explaining Evolution to people who have never really studied the subject and challenges the thinking of people who staunchly reject the idea Evolution. Likewise, he also encourages people who are unwilling to acknowledge the idea that God created the world to think deeply and reflect on the idea that maybe there is God who created them in His image, and that He loves them and cares for them in ways that we as humans could never imagine.

Reading through this book and several others, my daughter and I had many great conversations. I still don't have the perfect answer. My daughter and I still continue to discuss the topic as we learn something new or come across a new idea or way of thinking. 

What I have discovered for myself is that there are some things that we may never completely understand. In the case of "Science versus Evolution," the "debate" is part of the journey. It helps move us to ask deeper and more thought provoking questions than we were able to ask before. Rather than telling you exactly what I have come to believe, I will say what I do not believe. I do not believe the universe was created 8000 years ago in 6 24-hour days. I also do not believe that the Big Bang and Evolution came about because of chance without any influence from God, the creator of the universe.
