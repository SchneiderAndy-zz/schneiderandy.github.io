I started a blog over 10 years ago called [Get-PowerShell](http://get-powershell.com). It is a technical blog dedicated to PowerShell.
Well, it turns out, 10 years later, that there is more to life than just PowerShell. Will this blog have anything to do with PowerShell? Absolutely! Will it be limited to just technology? Absolutely Not!
